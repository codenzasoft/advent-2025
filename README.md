<h1>Advent of Code 2025</h1>

This repo contains solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025 challenge](https://adventofcode.com/). I have chosen to use Java and prioritized ease of reading, modifying, enhancing, and testing over performance.

Originally, I intended to download input data via HTTP requests to the advent of code site, but soon discovered that the site does not support such requests. Instead, the input files have been copied into this repo.
